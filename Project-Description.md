## Project background description
We want to create an application for iPhone/Android and a website around Coffee and Coffee Shops/Roasters. Brian has been a barista at a couple of different shops and frequents different shops/roasters in Cincinnati and when he travels. We wanted to create a one-stop app for the coffee enthusiast and novice alike! A big problem we have faced when traveling is trying to find local roasters to go visit - we want this to be an easy way to find the most popular roasters and their locations or shops they're sold at. On top of that, we want to add functionality such as being able to filter upon the type of shop it is (i.e. if it quiet, open late for studying, comfy, etc.). In order to elevate some of the initial intimidation that people who are new to coffee feel, we would have a list of different drink offerings at coffee shops and a description. Also, have it house recipes for different brewing apparatuses, including short descriptions and steps on how to use them and links to purchase them.

## Project problem statement
We've found it hard to find coffee roasters nearby that are local to the area you're in without having to use multiple sources. on top of that, it seems like everyone has a differing opinion on brewing recipes/ratios. This app will solve the problem of having to search multiple different sources of information by compiling it all into one source, conveniently, and accessible to all whether you're an enthusiast or someone trying to get more coffee-savvy.

## Inadequacy of current solutions to problem
Too many sources to hunt through (i.e. subreddit for the city, Yelp, TripAdvisor) with varying results, Apps that do exist have either a very small reach (i.e. limited number of cities to choose from) or have limited information around the cafes. Also, upon download of the two apps (BeanHunter & Cupper) I immediately found multiple faults in the systems causing the apps to crash, making it so backing out of a city choice was impossible, and location checking nearby a coffee shop would turn up no results. This proves to me that there is little updates/current development being pushed out to these "solutions" causing there to be a more functional alternative. 

## Background skills/interests applicable to problem
### Brian: 
* _Interest_: Prior barista, home coffee enthusiast, visits many coffee shops (locally/across US) 
* _Soft Skills_: Project management, communication, documentation of process, process creation, program management
* _Technical Skills_: Light development in JavaScript, C++, jQuery, SQL, HTML/CSS

## Team approach to problem
Utilize ReactJS framework to create application/website, backend database to store information about roasters and shops, host application using a cloud-based service
