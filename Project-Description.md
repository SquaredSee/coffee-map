## Project background description
*We want to create an application for iPhone/Android around Coffee and Coffee Shops/Roasters. Brian has been a barista at a couple of different shops and frequents different shops/roasters in Cincinnati and when he travels. We wanted to create a one-stop app for the coffee enthusiast! A big problem Brian has faced when traveling is trying to find local roasters to go visit, we want this to be an easy way to find the most popular places and their locations. On top of that, we want to add functionality such as being able to filter upon the type of shop it is (i.e. if it quiet, open late for studying, comfy, etc). Also, have it house recipes for different brewing apperatuses and short descriptions.
