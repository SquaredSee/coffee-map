## Project background description
We want to create an application for iPhone/Android and a website around Coffee and Coffee Shops/Roasters. Brian has been a barista at a couple of different shops and frequents different shops/roasters in Cincinnati and when he travels. We wanted to create a one-stop app for the coffee enthusiast and novice alike! A big problem we have faced when traveling is trying to find local roasters to go visit - we want this to be an easy way to find the most popular roasters and their locations or shops they're sold at. On top of that, we want to add functionality for the user to track their coffee tasting with the help of a log and also give the user brewing tips for those who want to brew at home.

## Project problem statement
We've found it hard to find coffee roasters nearby that are local to the area you're in without having to use multiple sources. When you do find it, unless you take a picture of the roaster, you can forget what you tried. We aim to simplify this process so that you can find coffee you love, track your taste, and master your brew.

## Inadequacy of current solutions to problem
Too many sources to hunt through (i.e. subreddit for the city, Yelp, TripAdvisor) with varying results, Apps that do exist have either a very small reach (i.e. limited number of cities to choose from) or have limited information around the cafes. Also, upon download of the two apps (BeanHunter & Cupper) I immediately found multiple faults in the systems causing the apps to crash, making it so backing out of a city choice was impossible, and location checking nearby a coffee shop would turn up no results. This proves to me that there is little updates/current development being pushed out to these "solutions" causing there to be a more functional alternative.
