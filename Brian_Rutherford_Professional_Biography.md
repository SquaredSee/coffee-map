## Project Saught
I want to create an application for iPhone/Android around something I’m passionate about: Coffee! I’ve been a barista at a couple of different shops and I frequent different shops/roasters in Cincinnati but also when I travel. I want to create a one-stop app for the coffee enthusiast! I want there to be easy to following brewing recipes, descriptions of different regions and their coffees, but mainly I want to build a database of roasters in different locations. A big problem I face when traveling is trying to find local roasters to go visit, I want this to be an easy way to find the most popular places and their locations. On top of that, I want to be able to filter upon the type of shop it is (i.e. if it quiet, open late for studying, comfy, etc).
