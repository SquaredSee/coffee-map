Directions:
{'\n\n'}1. Bring kettle water to a boil and remove from heat. Do this to keep the temperature of the moka pot from getting too hot and cooking the coffee, imparting a metallic taste.
{'\n\n'}2. Grind your coffee on a drip coffee setting, about as fine as table salt. You need enough coffee to fill the filter basket, which is about 15 to 17 grams (or about 2.5 Tablespoons) for a 4-cup Mokapot.
{'\n\n'}3. Add the heated water and fill to the line in the bottom of the brewer, or just up to the screw on the outside.
{'\n\n'}4. Insert the filter basket into the brewer bottom.
{'\n\n'}5. Fill the basket with coffee, slightly mounded, and level the surface off with your finger. Brush away loose grounds on the top edge of the filter basket.
{'\n\n'}6. Screw the top and bottom together. Use hot pads and donâ€™t over tighten.
{'\n\n'}7. Put the brewer on the stove, use moderate heat and make sure that the handle is not subjected to heat. Leave the top lid open.
{'\n\n'}8. The coffee will begin to come out and you will hear a puffing sound and see a rich-brown stream that will get progressively lighter in color. Once the stream is the color of yellow honey, remove from heat source with hot pads and close the lid.
{'\n\n'}9. Wrap the bottom of the pot in a chilled bar towel or run under cold tap water to stop extraction. We do this to prevent the coffee from developing a metallic taste. The idea here is to get a relatively small amount of coffee which is very concentrated and rich.
{'\n\n'}10. As soon as the coffee stops bubbling out, pour it into cups or a carafe. You may wish to dilute with hot water depending on preference.
{'\n\n'}11. Enjoy!
