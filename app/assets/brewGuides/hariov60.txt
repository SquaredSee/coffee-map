Directions:
{'\n\n'}1. Fold the filter into a cone shape and rinse it in the Hario dripper with water just off the boil (about 205°F) to eliminate paper flavor and to heat up the mug or carafe you are brewing into. Discard the rinse water.
{'\n\n'}2. Grind 21 grams (about 3 Tablespoons) of coffee to be about as fine as kosher salt. Add coffee to your brewer.
{'\n\n'}3. Saturate the grounds with water right off the boil (about 205°F). Use just enough water to cover the grounds. Let it bloom for 15 seconds. Coffee de-gasses or “blooms” when it’s fresh–the coffee bed should raise up and bubble a bit.
{'\n\n'}4. Pour water in a slow, even spiral, adding water every 10 – 15 seconds for an even extraction. Pour over the dark spots and avoid the light ones. If you're using a scale, you should pour until you reach 360 g.
{'\n\n'}5. Once you hit 3:00, you should have about 10 oz of brewed coffee. Remove the brewer and pour the coffee into a warm mug.
