1. Use a ratio of 3 ounces (roughly 85 grams)  of coarsely ground coffee to 16 ounces of purified water. For example, if you use a 32oz French Press, you would use 6:32.
2. Combine the coffee and the water together and stir, making sure all grounds are saturated.
3. Let sit at room temperature or in the fridge (recommended) for 12-20 hours.
4. When you've steeped for your desired time, use a thin coffee filter (like a chemex filter) and strain the coffee into different vessel for serving. Refrigerate the cold brew concentrate.
5. When you're ready to drink, start off with a 1:1 ratio of water:cold brew. Change as your taste desires.
6. Serve over ice and enjoy!
